# NCCU Deep Learning 
This is a repo for storing course outcomes of this NCCU online course about deep learning. In this course, I learnt:
* Basics of Jupyter Notebook
* Types of neural network
* How to build basic CNN and Feed-forward NN for MNIST recognition

The materials uploaded are adapted from the notes prepared by the instructor, which was originally in Chinese.
